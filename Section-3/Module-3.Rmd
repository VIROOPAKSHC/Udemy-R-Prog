FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS Section - 3 Homework

You have been supplied with two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the financial year in question. Your task is to calculate the following financial metrics:
- profit for each month- profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit a after tax divided by revenue
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year


```{r}

#Data
revenue <- c(14574.49, 7606.46, 8611.41, 9175.41, 8058.65, 8105.44, 11496.28, 9766.09, 10305.32, 14379.96, 10713.97, 15433.50)
expenses <- c(12051.82, 5695.07, 12319.20, 12089.72, 8658.57, 840.20, 3285.73, 5821.12, 6976.93, 16618.61, 10054.37, 3803.96)

profits <- revenue - expenses

profits.after.tax <- profits*(0.7)

profit.margin <- (profits.after.tax / revenue) * 100

good.months <- which(profits.after.tax > mean(profits.after.tax))

bad.months <- seq(1,12)[-good.months]

best.month <- which(profits.after.tax == max(profits.after.tax)
                    )

worst.month <- which(profits.after.tax == min(profits.after.tax))
